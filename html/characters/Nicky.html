                    <h2>Nicky Hemmick</h2>
                    <p>Nicky is the cousin of Andrew and Aaron. He is not on good terms with his parents, who refuse to accept his sexuality, and because of this he studied in Germany for a year. While he was there, he met Erik, who was a part of his 'host family.' He would eventually begin a commited relationship with Erik, which he continued even after he went back to America and started college.</p>

                </h3>
                <h4>Family life</h4>
                <p>Nicky is the only son of Luther and Maria Hemmick. His mother was 'rescued' from Mexico by his father, a Baptist minister, while he was doing volunteer work in Ensenada. Nicky was born and raised in <i>Columbia</i>, South Carolina.</p>
                <h4>Germany</h4>
                <p>Nicky is a gay man, but struggled with this in his religious and homophobic household. As a result of this, his difficult relationship with his parents and the repression of his own sexuality, he became depressed. Nicky spent his senior year of high school on a study abroad program in Berlin, Germany in an attempt to get away from his home life. While in Germany, he would meet his host brother, <i>Erik Klose</i>, who he would gradually form a relationship with. Nicky would return to America only long enough to graduate from high school, and then he would return to Germany and live with Erik until his aunt Tilda died, and he would come back to take custody of his cousins, <i>Andrew</i> and <i>Aaron</i>, to keep them away from his own upbringing.</p>
                <h4>Becoming a Fox</h4>
                <p>During his time with his cousins, Nicky was attacked in front of a nightclub by four men. Andrew came to his defense and nearly beat them to death in an effort to defend Nicky, which put him in legal trouble. Nicky intended to only stay in America until the twins finished high school, but was offered a position as a backliner for the <i>Foxes</i> by <i>Coach Wymack</i>, a choice which Erik supported wholeheartedly. Because of the time he took off between high school and college, although Nicky is only a sophomore during the series, he is the second oldest member on the team after Renee.</p>

                <p>Nicky is generally cheerful and happy. He is easily upset by the tragedies that many of his teammates experience during the series. He attempts to get along with everyone, though he sticks with Andrew's lot during most of the series. He is closest with Aaron. </p>
                <p>It is noted by Neil that Nicky's personality is probably more reserved than he typically shows, but that he portrays himself as loud, optimistic, and extroverted as a way to compensate for how closed off the twins are. </p>

Nicky drugs Neil in Eden's Twilight by kissing him and forcing cracker dust into his mouth. He later apologizes before their first game of the season, but Neil is unsure whether he can forgive him. During the series they develop a closer friendship and put it behind them, never speaking of the incident again.</p>
