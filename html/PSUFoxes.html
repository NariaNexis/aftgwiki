        <h3>Palmetto State Foxes</h3>
        <hr class="solid">
        <p>The <i>exy</i> team of <i>Palmetto State University.</i> Founded by <i>Coach Wymack,</i> its mission is to give athletes from a broken home another chance, functioning as a "half-way house". Unfortunately, this makes them a hard team to train, because the players don't harmonise easily. </p>
        <p>The Foxes have a reputation for being mentally unstable and the laughingstock of the nation.</p>
        <p>Foxes practice at the <i>Foxhole Court</i> and the gym. They live on the third floor of <i>Fox Tower,</i> the athletes' dormitory.</p>
        <p>The Foxes donate a portion of their ticket sales to charity, making their tickets a little more expensive than the other teams' tickets. This was <i>Renee</i>'s idea. The girls want to involve the Foxes in more charity projects.</p>

            <h4>History</h4>
            <hr class="solid">
            <p>In their first year, Palmetto State allegedly refused to sign any female players Coach Wymack asked for. After their disastrous first season, he was allowed to sign the three women and made Dan captain - the first female team captain in NCAA Class I Exy.</p>
            <p>The first three years of they ranked last in national championships, only improving the year before Neil joined them, due to the addition of Andrew, Aaron and Nicky, and Kevin as assistant coach. They won championships the year Neil joined. </p>
            <p>The Foxes had to endure fallout from some Kevin's fans when he transferred from the Ravens. There were break-ins, threatening phone calls, rabid press, vandalism, death threats, and someone accused the upperclassmen of running a meth lab in their dorm room, which resulted in a police raid. Other fans sent letters and flowers mourning the loss of his playing hand. </p>

            <h4>Team Dynamics</h4>
            <hr class="solid">
            <p>The Foxes are a ragtag band of individuals. At the start of a year, they needed a certain amount of time to fight over their hierarchy, although Dan is accepted as team captain unequivocally. Seth and Kevin fight often, even on court during games, and Matt has to separate them physically whenever they don't to listen to Dan. This made Neil think that Matt should have been captain, because he inspired solidarity. Kevin's criticism is the cause for most fights on the court.</p>
            <p>Although Seth is the only fifth-year, his isolationism prevented him from impacting the team in a positive way. Allison had some say due to her seniority and aggressiveness, although she hated working with the cousins. Aaron tried not to get involved. Nicky was enthusiastic but liked picking fights with Allison and Seth. Andrew put in as little effort as he could get away with, and influence over Kevin and his talent made him useful to the team. When Neil first joined he wasn't a part of the hierarchy because of his inexperience.</p>
            <p>Wymack doesn't interfere with their fights, although he punishes them with cardio and drills.</p>
            <p>There is an understanding between all Foxes to not pry into other people's business. Neil speculates that it has to do with all of them coming from broken homes and knowing that questions are uncomfortable. Mostly, they don't question other people's odd behavior or habits.</p>
            <p>A favorite pastime of the team is betting on even the smallest things, be it relationships or how a person will react to a specific event. The betting pool can get quite big, depending on the topic.</p>

            <h4>Recruiting</h4>
            <hr class="solid">
            <p>For Neil's freshman year, the Foxes originally recruited <i>Janie Smalls</i> as a striker sub. When she attempts suicide and is hospitalized, Wymack recruits Neil, at Kevin's request. No other player was approached that year.</p>
            <p>At the end of Neil's first year, Wymack recruits six players for the Foxes to meet the new <i>ERC</i> rules. </p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h4>Gear</h4>
            <hr class="solid">
            <p>The Foxes have five outfits for workouts and a set of both home and away uniforms. Every Fox also has a windbreaker in bright orange, bearing their name and the word "Foxes" on the back in reflective material. They also have two racquets that are dark orange with a single white stripe at the base and white netting, each made to the specification of the individual player.</p>

            <h4>Practice</h4>
            <hr class="solid">
            <p>Summer practice begins June 10th the year Neil arrives. Athletes must move onto campus the day before. Practice starts at 8:30 in the gym. On the last day before classes, Wymack gives them the afternoon off.</p>
            <p>During the semester, the Foxes practice 2 hours in the morning (6-8) at the gym and 5 hours in the afternoon (3-8) at the Foxhole Court. Afternoon training is cancelled on the day of a game.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h4>Medical Care</h4>
            <hr class="solid">
            <p>Once a semester, the Foxes have to undergo a physical examination. Because it involves blood work, it has to be done at least a day before training starts. Other areas that are checked are weight, height, reflexes, blood pressure and a check for track marks. Athletes are not allowed to play if they don't participate and Abby signs off on them.</p>
            <p>Once each semester every team member has to meet with Betsy for a psychological check-up. During their first session, the Foxes are only there to get to know Betsy, subsequent sessions are supposed to be real therapy sessions. The Foxes go to her in pairs during training the day before classes start. In Neil's first year, the order is Matt and Dan, Aaron and Kevin, Seth and Allison, Nicky and Andrew, Neil and Renee. Wymack determined this order so that it would leave all positions covered for scrimmages.</p>

            <h4>Support</h4>
            <hr class="solid">
            <p>The Foxes are supported on game nights by the PSU cheer leading squad, the Vixens, and the school band, Orange Notes. They travel separately to away games.</p>

            <h4>Games</h4>
            <hr class="sollid">
            <p>At home games, the Foxes are expected to be at the stadium 45 minutes before serve. Games start at 7 pm.</p>
            <p>The Foxes enter the court on games ordered by position, with Dan at the beginning as the captain.</p>
            <p>Substitute players are expected to cheer their team mates on through the court walls.</p>
            <p>Even during games, Seth and Kevin fight on court, although the team can mostly put their off-court differences aside and play together.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h4>Team Bus</h4>
            <hr class="solid">
            <p>The team bus is used to transport the Foxes to away games. Usually, it is locked up in a gated compound to prevent vandalism. The bus is white with orange trim and paw prints. Inside, there's only one row of seats, which are big enough for two people and made of leather. Wymack usually drives.</p>
