        <h3>Palmetto State Foxes</h3>
        <p>The <i>exy</i> team of <i>Palmetto State University.</i> Founded by <i>Coach Wymack,</i> its mission is to give athletes from a broken home another chance, functioning as a "half-way house". Unfortunately, this makes them a hard team to train, because the players don't harmonise easily. </p>
        <p>The Foxes have a reputation for being mentally unstable and the laughingstock of the nation.</p>
        <p>Foxes practice at the <i>Foxhole Court</i> and the gym. They live on the third floor of <i>Fox Tower,</i> the athletes' dormitory.</p>
        <p>The Foxes donate a portion of their ticket sales to charity, making their tickets a little more expensive than the other teams' tickets. This was <i>Renee</i>'s idea. The girls want to involve the Foxes in more charity projects.</p>
